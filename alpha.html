        <p class="message" style="color: greenyellow;">I love you more than words can expressðŸ’•, and my heart belongs to you. Every moment with you means the world to me, and the depth of my feelings for you is immeasurable. But with all that love comes a pain ðŸ’”that cuts deeper ðŸ˜¢than anything Iâ€™ve ever felt. It hurts to feel like Iâ€™m treated as an option when Iâ€™ve always considered you my everything. I just want to be the one who matters to you as much as you mean to me.</p>
        <p class="message" style="color: greenyellow;">Please understand that this love comes with a vulnerability I canâ€™t hide, and the ache from feeling like Iâ€™m not your priority is something I canâ€™t easily shake. I just want to be your one and only.</p>
<br><br>
<p>THANKS ðŸ¤žFOR TAKING YOUR TIME ON THIS...BEFORE LEAVING THIS SITE, REMEMBER AND ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS,,<br>
All this doesn't mean that I don't notice or appreciate the happiness you give and the joy you are to me.
I notice all your effort to be that lady I always dream of you being. I also notice the effort you make to always mantain 
joy in Thee Ancie Family... I'm just expressing all these to make you aware that I'm REALLY Hurt..My Heart Hurts In the 
worst possible way.ðŸ’”ðŸ˜­</p>
